      Gameplay changes compared to Counter Strike: Global Offensive Counter
      Strike 2 has introduced many changes compared to its predecessor. Graphics
      The game is powered by the Source 2 engine , which has resulted in updated
      graphics. All maps, the main menu, and the inventory interface have been
      refreshed. Realistic blood stains and splatter caused by enemy hits have
      been added, directed in the direction of impact [ 3 ] . The bomb explosion
      effect has also been improved, with a larger radius and greater impact on
      some maps [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . Animations have been introduced for the
      player-controlled character's legs moving while walking [ 8 ] [ 9 ] .
      Classification and Ranking System In the tournament mode, the ranking
      system (from "Silver I" to "World Elite") is retained, but a new feature
      is the introduction of a separate rank for each map [ 10 ] . A new
      classification system has been added for Premier mode, where a player's
      position is symbolized by a color (from gray to gold) and an assigned
      number ranging from 0 to 35,000 [ 11 ] [ 12 ] . Changed grenade rules The
      smoke produced by grenades has gained new properties – it can be dispersed
      by the explosion of an offensive grenade or by passing projectiles [ 3 ] .
      A new feature is the addition of a slight tint in the color of the team to
      which the player threw the smoke grenade (smoke produced by a member of
      the counter-terrorist team is tinted gray-blue, while smoke from the
      terrorist team is sandy yellow) [ 13 ] . Molotov cocktails have also been
      changed in the game, in addition to receiving new animations, they now
      produce quieter burning sounds when used [ 14 ] . Off-Tick Updates
      Tickrate is the number of data packets downloaded from the server per
      second [ 15 ] [ 16 ] . Thanks to the off-tick update system, the game can
      receive information from the server outside of individual ticks (the
      moment of downloading packets), which improves its performance [ 3 ] [ 17
      ] and positively affects gameplay elements, such as movement or throwing
      grenades [ 16 ] . Removing skyboxes In Counter-Strike 2, skyboxes were
      removed , allowing grenades to be thrown more effectively (in
      Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, some grenade trajectories were blocked
      by the skybox) [ 18 ] [ 13 ] . Items unavailable in Counter-Strike 2
      compared to previous versions of the game Danger zone mode [ 19 ] ; The
      premiere version did not include some maps [ 20 ] [ 21 ] ; In the initial
      version of the game, the ability to hold a weapon with the left hand was
      unavailable [ 20 ] , but the update from April 26, 2024 restored this
      ability [ 22 ] . History Several years before the game's release,
      speculation began among the community about porting Counter Strike: Global
      Offensive to the Source 2 engine. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The game was
      announced and made available to a limited group of users for testing on
      March 22 , 2023. [ 26 ] Calendar of changes in selected test versions of
      the game On March 22, 2023, the first beta version of Counter-Strike 2 was
      released . Players received a refreshed version of the Dust 2 map and two
      game modes for testing: deathmatch and tournament [ 26 ] . On June 6th,
      the weapon purchase menu was refreshed. The circular inventory was
      abandoned in favor of a new one, dividing weapons into categories and
      providing a "slotted" inventory. In the main menu, the player can select
      weapons available in the inventory. Slots have been divided into three new
      categories. The player can choose one starting pistol (received for free
      at the start of the round), four pistols, five "medium weapons" (shotguns
      and submachine guns), and five "heavy weapons" (machine guns, M249, Negev)
      [ 27 ] . This configuration allows the selection of both weapons (e.g.,
      M4A1S and M4A4), from which previously only one slot was available [ 28 ]
      . This update replaces the Dust 2 map with the Mirage map, and provides
      tools for creating new weapon skins and decals [ 27 ] . On June 29th, the
      grenade inspection feature was introduced. A new game mode was also
      introduced – Simplified, and the maps were replaced with two new ones –
      Office and Nuke [ 29 ] [ 30 ] . On July 17, the Office and Nuke maps were
      removed. They were replaced with the remastered Overpass and Vertigo maps.
      This version also introduced the Wingman game mode . [ 31 ] August 2nd –
      Previous maps were replaced with Anubis and Ancient. The Wingman game mode
      was also removed and the Chicken Swimming feature was introduced [ 32 ] .
      On August 15th, the tournament mode was removed and the private match
      feature was disabled. The Anubis and Ancient maps were replaced with a
      remastered version of the Italy map. This version also improved the
      appearance of hostages [ 33 ] . On August 17, all maps that had ever
      appeared in the test versions of the game were made available [ 34 ] . On
      August 31st, the ranking system was refreshed and the game was made
      available for testing by a wider audience. This version also introduced
      the Premier game mode, and matches were shortened from 30 to 24 rounds
      (with the option to extend by 6 additional rounds in the event of a draw)
      [ 35 ] . A refreshed version of the Inferno map was also added [ 36 ] . On
      September 5th, the tournament game mode was made available again . [ 37 ]
      A day later, the waiting time for players in the Premier game mode was
      reduced from 5 to 2 minutes . [ 38 ]
